# OpenSim-Split-Robust-Example

This repository contains configuration files that can be used as basis for a distributed robust setup of [OpenSimulator](http://opensimulator.org)

They are based on a testing environment maintained by [Zetamex Network](https://zetamex.com) and may contain parameters exclusive to their version of OpenSimulator.

Included are configurations for a [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) server acting as reverse proxy serving requests to OpenSimulator. Also included are the respective configuration files for a Simulator connecting to the OpenSimulator Robust configured with this configuration.

Code changes to OpenSimulator or the version Zetamex Network maintains may not be reflected here and absolutely no warranty is given on the accuracy of this configuration. Use at your own risk.
